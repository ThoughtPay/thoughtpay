* Make sure your code is up to date
```
        git pull --rebase

* Start working on your story committing often  
* The commit messages should be using the pipe form and be descriptive of the work completed in that commit:  
**#cardNumber | Name & Name | commit message**
* When your work is complete, run all tests to make sure you didnâ€™t break anything
* Push your work to master, this will trigger our Snap-CI pipeline
* Watch the build and make sure it stays green
