#Welcome

For new members of the development team, there are a number of things that need to be set up:
- GitHub
- [Mingle](Mingle)
- Slack
- Google Calendar
- Google Drive shared folder

If you are tasked with adding a new member to the team, you will need administrator privileges in each area. Also, don't forget to use their ThoughtWorks email where emails are needed.


##Goodbye

Just like we set them up, we should make sure to tear them down. If there is a member of the team that is leaving and does not need access anymore for maintenance or other reasons, we should remove their authorizations in the same applications above.
