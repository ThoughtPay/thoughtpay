# #26 Update Basic User Profile

#### UserController
  * Put works
  * Do we need `@ModelAttribute`? What does it do? Why does it work 0.o


#### Bean Configuration - Spring can find stuff from hardcoded values so we donâ€™t need it in the constructor
  * Makes tests less fragile (now we can use a mock)
  * Bean is defined with annotations and not in XML - easier to understand

#### home.jsp
  * Include hidden field in home.jsp for id because we get users by id
  * Do we need this?
  * We do not know how spring works
