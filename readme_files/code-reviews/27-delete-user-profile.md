# Delete User Profile

### Questions

* Buttons as forms? do we need multiple forms? spring method to bind button to put/get/delete?
    * JS would help with this.... create function, add event handler
* Should delete check if item present?
* We want a more descriptive vocabulary of what we want to do with these calls --> so put/get/whatever would be to /users/{user.id} rather than /users/{user.id}/update or whatever

### Action Items

* Delete user -> delete
* Keep "in delete check if item in hashmap" in mind, modify if necessary when we get to persistence or when neccessary
* Look into getting rid of all the button forms
* Look into viability of john's idea
